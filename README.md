This is a exciting port of the classic game Chicken Gun, now available for WebGL through the powerful Unity WebGL platform! The process of adapting this game was a labor of love that required a significant amount of time and effort, but I am thrilled to share it with you. I sincerely hope that you derive as much pleasure from playing it as I did from creating it. Although the game is currently only accessible offline due to the lack of PUT 1 support, I am confident that this will not hinder your enjoyment of the experience. Embracing the spirit of innovation and dedication, this port represents a bridge between nostalgia and cutting-edge technology, promising endless hours of entertainment and fun for all those who embark on this digital journey. So, take a moment to immerse yourself in this immersive world where chickens and guns collide in a kaleidoscope of excitement and challenge. Let yourself be captivated by the thrill of the gameplay and the satisfaction of mastering each level. And remember, this is just the beginning - there are many more adventures awaiting you in the vast universe of Unity WebGL. So, without further ado, dive into this captivating game and unleash your inner gamer as you embark on this thrilling virtual escapade.

The reason why the play button doesnt work is because chicken gun uses PUN 1 which is not supported by Unity WebGL, sooo, you can only customise your chicken... Not really the end of the world but this is more like a attempt!
